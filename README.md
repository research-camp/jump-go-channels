# GO Channels Scheduling

How do Queue Channels work in ```Golang```? In this paper we are going to talk about
```Golang``` Channels and how are they implemented, and how we can use them as Queue Channels.
In the next steps we are going to change the queue algorithem in order to make priority queue
or other scheduling algorithms in ```Golang``` Channels.
